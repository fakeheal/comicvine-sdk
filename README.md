# 🦸 Comicvine PHP SDK

Welcome to the **Comicvine PHP SDK**, a lightweight and easy-to-use SDK designed to interact with
the [Comicvine API](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/), built on top of the robust [Saloon](https://docs.saloon.dev)
library.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is a work in progress. Currently, it supports only the endpoints I need for another app I'm building.
> However, the SDK is designed to be extensible, making it easy to add support for additional endpoints.
